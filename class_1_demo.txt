
THis program highlights

every day 2 hours session + 2 hours internship
Myself would be taking the sessions + another coordinator will guide
learners during the internship period

THis course is for 3.5 to 4 months duration

we have all the collboration tools are available like Jira, Teams, Github.

This course is available as online as well as offline

FOr doing this course we would be needed anaconda environment.
Anaconda is python environment for doing Datascience projects
It is freely downloadable from anaconda site

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qve5JTd1OSA

TO download and install anaconda in windows environment.
IT is a straight forward approach, it can be installable by
following the video.

20 Nov 2023 Session

Python: 
For feature engineering
Cleaning the data also cover imputations
encoding the data
scaling the data
Machine learning/Deep learning/ Generative AI modeling
Deployment

Topic we would be learning in Python.
1. Basics of python
Loops, conditionals, functions, file processing, exceptions
Basic data structures like list, dictionary, tuple, set

2. Data handling in Python using Pandas
Pandas is basically python module to handling the data easily
we will be dealing with 2 dimensional data
2 dimenstional data => data with rows and columns

We will get the data from data engineers in the form of Excel or CSV file
we need query the database using SQL queries
SQL => Structured Query language

SQL => DQL, DML, DDL

DQL => data query language queries
example: select statement

DML => data modification language queries
Example: update statement

DDL => data definition language queries
Example: create statement

Python:
Python is Indented, Interpreted, functional, object oriented programming
language

Indented Programming language:
--------------------------------
In programming languages like C,C++, Java.
we will compile the code after finishing coding activity.
we might get any errors or warnings from the code, we will fix the errors
and warnings.
we will get executable of the code
we will be running the executable to get the desired functionality of operation
This type of languages are called compiled languages

Where are python is an interpreted langugage=> it doesnot goes through compilation process
after finishing code we will simply run the file.
If there are any error s or warning, it will show the errors. If there are no errors
the code would be executed

Object oriented programming language:
-------------------------------------
In real world every item is associated with properties and functionalities
Example: car
properties
4 wheels
4 doors
AC
engine
functionalities:
we can travel in car
We can have AC in car

Every item in the python is called object.
every object is associated with data/properties/attributes and functions

Indentation:
------------
include <stdio.h> /* C language hello  world program */
main()
{
printf("hello world");
}

# python code

def main():
    print("hello world")

we need to start with new indent( leaving 4 spaces ) while we start any loop or if else or function
some people use tab also but 4 spaces is the recommended best practice

Leaving spaces like this with out having curly braces is called indentation

functional:
-----------
we can send a function as an argument to any other function
also we can return any function from any other function

Data types:
-----------
Basic data types:
Chars, Strings, Integers, Floats
'c'     "Hello"   123      34.12

Basic Python data types:
List  => it is collection of items enclosed in square brackets [ ]
         Any type of data items of any repeatations
         it is a mutable(means we can alter the data items inside the list)
         we can access the items using the index
example: list1 = ['apple', 'orange', 12.56, 6745, 'apple', 'v', 'apple', 12.56, 897]

Dictionary => it is collection of key value pairs enclosed by { }
            keys are unique( keys are not repeatable )
            no index
            mutable, we can modify the data inside dictionary

example: di1 = {'a':"apple",'b':"bombay",'c':"cat",100:"one hundred"}

Tuple => it is a collection of itemd eclosed in normal bracker ( )
         Any type of data items of any repeatations
         it is immutable ( means we cannot alter the data items )
         we can also access the items using the index
example: tuple1 = ('apple', 'orange', 12.56, 6745, 'apple', 'v', 'apple', 12.56, 897)


Set => Set is a collections of items enclosed by curly brackets { }
       Any typeof items, NO REPEATATIONs ( no duplicates )
       we cannot access using the index
example: set1 = {'apple', 'orange', 12.56, 6745, 'v',897}



list1 = ['apple', 'orange', 12.56, 6745, 'apple', 'v', 'apple', 12.56, 897]
#          0         1        2     3       4      5     6       7      8

Index starts with 0 and ends with n-1 where n is the length of the list

print(list1[0]) # apple
print(list1[8]) # 897
print(list1[12]) # Index error

We use anaconda python environment for datascience projects

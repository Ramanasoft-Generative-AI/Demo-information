
Welcome to Prompt Engineering course Demo.

Prompt engineering !!!!!
ChatGPT ? 

We are here to understand what is the technology behind chatGPT => 
GPT => 

to understand GPT => We do require some prerequsites: 

Python
Statistics 
Machine learning 
Deep learning '
=> Generative ai => GPT /promptengineering 

As part of this course we will cover all the pre requisites and make you ready to do a project on GPT 

=> We need to understand python => 2 weeks 
=> Statistics  =>  1 and half week  => 
=> Machine learning  => 
=> DL
=> AI 
=> Generative AI  => 

4 months program  => 

2 hours lecture  + 2 hours internship =>  4 hours  and into 4 months 

in between we will prepare your resume  after 2 months as a ML engineer 

another slot is  DL  =>  3 months

Finally  after completing this course we are eligible for GEnerative AI  /Prompt engineering  profile  and 
make your self ready for  fresher job or your first job or 
search for your new job or transormation => 

We will have senior faculty  surya bhanu  for entire courseteaching 

and project coordinator  to make you ready with all project work 
KT session 
work assignment 
work review 
and conducting the mock interview after every chapter 
=> In the internship we do provide tool like 
mcirosoft teams for your team collbration 
JIRA  for project work 
Infinity  for all your classroom notes and assignments 
github for code repository 

we have a placement officer =>  he/she  will accomidate all the resurce pariticapting in internship 
with all job openings avaialbel with our client 

this service is avaialble upto 12 months 

We continously focus on feedback and improvement actions 

=================================================================
Recently we placed one fresher 17LPA   in MNC
===================================================================
Bhanu sir is here to take up the technical session 

8.30am to 10.30 am for your technical training after that we have a break 15min 
and then we will start working assignments .  this tasks will start from monday/tuesday we will all the toools for you .
=====================================================================
doing the work rather than reading the work.

chat+gpt
chat => it is a verb
gpt is a name of the algorithm => generative pretrained transformer 
chat gpt is not real time
We can make chat bots, summeriztion, seq to seq,

LSTM => long short term memory training
It needs large data, it needs large computation capability, it needs very huge amount of time to train
sequential learning

GPT training is split two parts
1. pretraining
2. fine tuning needs very less amount data/time/CPU resources
